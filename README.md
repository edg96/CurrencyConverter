# Currency Converter

Currency Converter is a Python application that allows you to quickly and easily convert between various currencies using up-to-date exchange rates provided by the National Bank of Romania (BNR). This project uses a custom-built graphical user interface (GUI) created with custom tkinter to provide a user-friendly experience.
